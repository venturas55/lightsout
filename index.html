            <h2>Instrucciones</h2>
            <p>Estas son las instrucciones de tu aplicación. Léelas con atención.</p>

            <p>
                LIGHTS OUT has 3 different GAME MODES of play.
                The goal in all 3 MODES is the same, but each one
                provides a different challenge, and beginning players
                will probably want to start with MODE 1.</p>
            <p>
                MODE 1- 50 pre-programmed puzzles, each
                progressively more difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                MODE 2- Over 1000 randomly selected puzzles.
                Can you solve them all?</p>
            <p>
                MODE 3- Create your own puzzles, and try them
                out on a friend!</p>
            <p>
                ON/OFF: Turns the game ON or OFF. Your LIGHTS
                OUT game will shut off automatically after
                3 minutes of non-play.</p>
            <p>
            <p>START : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>a) Starts each game.</li>
                <li> b) Confirms a selected puzzle (MODE 1 and 2).</li>
                <li> c) Confirms an input puzzle (MODE 3).</li>
                <li> d) Restarts the puzzle (regardless of how
                    many “moves” have been made).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SELECT: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> a) Selects between MODES 1, 2, or 3.</li>
                <li>b) Exits the current puzzle (and advances to next mode).</li>
                <li> c) Selects a previously solved puzzle (MODES 1 and 2).</li>
            </ul>

            <p> SOUND : Toggles the sound ON and OFF.</p>


            <p> HELP : Receive “hints” from the computer
                (MODES 1 and 2). The HELP button will
                give you the first two moves of a puzzle,
                one move with each press. However,
                once a player has pressed a button, this
                feature is disabled until the puzzle is
                solved or re-started.</p>
            <p>

            <h2> PLAYING THE GAME</h2>
            <p>
                PRESS THE "ON" BUTTON to turn on the unit. You
                will now see a pattern of lights chasing around the
                board. This is followed by the appearance of the
                cross pattern.This pattern is a representation of
                what would happen if you pressed the center button
                while all of the lights were off on the game. As you
                can see, the center button is lit, as are the 4
                surrounding buttons.</p>
            <p>
                PRESS THE "START" BUTTON If this is your first
                time playing LIGHTS OUT, three buttons in row
                three will light.... This is Puzzle 1 (Mode 1).
                To understand the solution to a puzzle, think of the
                LIGHTS OUT puzzle
                display in terms of
                numbers. Each button
                (or light) on the puzzle
                can be assigned a
                number from 1 to 25
                (see adjacent illustration)
                For Puzzle 1 (Mode 1), you should see button
                numbers 11, 13, and 15 lit up on your display.
                Since your goal is to shut off the lights in the fewest
                moves possible, you will need to decide which buttons to
                press. Remember, each button press effects the
                surrounding buttons, so plan your moves carefully.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if button 12 is pressed, the lights on
                buttons 11 and 13 will be shut off, but now buttons 7,
                12, and 17 will be turned on. Follow the illustrations
                on the next page, and try it out on the actual game to
                understand how to recognize certain patterns.
            </p>
            <p>

                After a puzzle has been solved in MODE 1, you can
                try to improve your solution by accessing that puzzle
                again in MODE 1 by using the SELECT button. Simply
                press SELECT at any time during a puzzle (this turns
                all the lights out), then press the button number of
                the puzzle you want to choose, followed by the
                START button.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note - You cannot select a puzzle number higher
                than the last puzzle you were working on. For
                example, if the last puzzle you complete is number
                12 in MODE 1, you cannot select puzzle 14 until
                you solve 13 first! </p>
            <p>
                Remember, if necessary, you can always shut off the
                game and it will return you to the beginning of the
                last puzzle you were working on when you’re ready
                to play again! Your Lights Out game will shut-off
                automatically after 3 minutes of non-play.</p>

            <h2>THE HELP FEATURE</h2>
            <p>
                If you seem to be stuck on a puzzle, this is a good
                way to get you back on the right track. The Help
                feature can be used in MODES 1 and 2 on puzzles
                requiring 10 moves or less (in MODE 1, these are
                puzzles 1-25). When you start a puzzle, you can
                either jump right in, or press the HELP button for
                advice. The computer will show you the best
                possible move to make, and then automatically
                make that move for you. Press it again to see the
                most logical second step. The computer will only
                show you the first two moves, and then you’ll need
                to proceed on you’re own. Remember, this help
                feature can only be used at the beginning of a
                puzzle, and can’t be used at all in the more
                advanced (11 steps or higher) puzzles!</p>

            <h2>THE SAVE FEATURE</h2>
            <p>
                As we mentioned, you can shut off the game and
                return to the “current” puzzle at any point. There
                are a few exceptions, however. This save feature will
                not work in MODE 3 with the player-created puzzles,
                and the game will be re-set when the batteries are
                removed for replacement.</p>

            <h2>SELECTING PUZZLE MODES</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you have solved Puzzle 1 in Mode 1, it is
                time to learn how to access each of the three
                different Puzzle Modes in Lights Out.</p>

            <h4>MODE 1</h4>
            <p>
                After turning Lights Out on, pressing the start
                button automatically defaults you to the last puzzle
                you tried to solve in Mode 1.
                Mode 1 enables you to solve 50 pre-programmed
                puzzles, each one more difficult from the last.
                Solving a beginning puzzle can be as few as 6 steps,
                while the more advanced puzzles could require up to
                15 steps! For the first 25 pre-programmed puzzles,
                only one blinking light will appear. </p>

            <p>
                Similar to the method for the first 25 puzzles, you
                can tell how many moves are required for the more
                advanced puzzles 26-50. </p>
            <h2>REMEMBER</h2>
            <p>
                The challenge of Lights Out is to solve a puzzle in
                the minimum number of moves required. When
                you solve a puzzle in the minimum number of
                moves, you will be rewarded with a blinking light
                show chasing around the entire display. Lights Out
                will then automatically display the next puzzle! If you
                go over the minimum number of moves, the number
                of moves you exceed by will flash on your display,
                but you can still proceed to the next puzzle as long
                as you do not exceed 10 moves! For example,
                solving a 6 step puzzle in 8 steps will display two
                blinking lights! If you solve a puzzle in more than 10
                steps over the minimum number of moves, a lighted
                “X” will appear on screen and you will have to try
                again before advancing to the next puzzle!</p>
            <h2>MODE 2</h2>
            <p>
                MODE 2 is similar to MODE 1, except that all the
                puzzles are randomly generated by the computer.
                You will be able to tell how many moves are required
                to solve a puzzle right before the puzzle appears as
                you did in MODE 1 (see previous charts).
                NOTE: when you access MODE 2, the default
                game, or first game in MODE 2, will be the same
                puzzle level you achieved in MODE 1. So, if the
                last puzzle you are working on in MODE 1 is an
                eight step puzzle, you will start off with eight step
                puzzles in MODE 2.
                In Mode 2, you can go back to any puzzle level up to
                the last puzzle level you achieved in Mode 1, by
                simply pressing the select button at any time, then
                pressing the button number of the puzzle you want
                to choose, followed by the start button. </p>
            <h2>MODE 3</h2>
            <p>
                You could call this “Lights In”, since you are now
                given the chance to input your own puzzles to
                challenge yourself and your friends! Of course, you
                have to figure out how to solve them too, so don’t
                try to get too tricky! When you select MODE 3 with
                the SELECT button and push "Start", you are able to
                press as many of the buttons on the keypad as you
                like. Each time a button is pressed once, it will light
                up. When you have finished creating, press start
                again to begin your puzzle.
                Note: it is possible to create a puzzle that is so
                difficult, it may not have an answer! That is why
                we have provided 1,000 puzzles for you to
                program and try to solve. The following pages
                will list these puzzles by the minimum number of
                moves it takes to solve them, starting with 6 step
                puzzles. Simply push the buttons listed for each
                puzzle and then press the Start button to
                challenge yourself and your friends!</p>
